<h2>HepForge user guide</h2>
<p>This is the guide to the services provided by <a href="http://www.hepforge.org/" title="HepForge">HepForge</a>.  Please check here
and in the <a href="https://www.hepforge.org/docs/faq" title="Frequently asked questions&quot;">FAQ</a> if you have a problem with the system. If you can't find
an answer there, email us at <a href="mailto:admin@hepforge.org" title="HepForge contact email">admin@hepforge.org</a>.</p>
<h3>Shell account and filespace</h3>
<p>Your HepForge account gives you full Unix shell access to our server, with user
privileges: login by SSH'ing to <span class="generic">username</span>@login.hepforge.org.  You have personal webspace,
if you want to use it, at <kbd>http://users.hepforge.org/~<span class="generic">username</span></kbd> which can be accessed by creating a
personal <kbd>public_html</kbd> directory containing HTML files: <kbd>mkdir
~/public_html; touch ~/public_html/index.html</kbd> should do the trick. These
pages will be visible on the Web at <kbd>http://users.hepforge.org/~<span class="generic">username</span>/</kbd>.</p>
<h3>Project information</h3>
<p>Each project has a home directory located at <kbd>/hepforge/home/<span class="generic">projname</span></kbd>: the files in this directory should be
group writeable. This contains a directory called <kbd>project-config</kbd>, in
which various configuration files for the project are contained. You can edit
these files, but be careful!</p>
<p>Aside from the configuration files for the Trac bug tracker and wiki system,
your <kbd>~<span class="generic">projname</span>/project-config</kbd> area
contains the <kbd>htpasswd</kbd> and <kbd>htgroup</kbd> files for
password-protecting areas of your Web space (see the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/howto/auth.html">Apache documentation</a>
for more information) and a <kbd>project.xml</kbd> file.</p>
<h4>project.xml</h4>
<p>The <kbd>~<span class="generic">projname</span>/project.xml</kbd> file is used
to define various features of your project. At the moment it is mainly used to
define a "display name" and a short description for your project: these are used
when generating the default title for HepForge web pages and in the project and
download lists. In future, the "keywords" and "categories" elements in the XML
file will be used for project categorisation and searching: we'll let you know
how that works when we've decided!</p>
<h3>Web space</h3>
<p>You have project web space in <kbd>/hepforge/home/<span class="generic">projname</span>/public_html</kbd>. This can be viewed by
pointing your Web browser to <kbd>http://<span class="generic">projname</span>.hepforge.org/</kbd>.
For the most part, the HepForge project
web space is just like any normal web space, but there are a few special
features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A small HepForge "branding bar" is added to the top of each page; </li>
<li>Each page has some simple styling information associated with it. You can over-ride this if you want; </li>
<li>Basic HTML tags will be added to the top and bottom of each page if they aren't already there; </li>
<li>You can use PHP and CGI scripts to generate page content, which will run as the project user;</li>
<li>There is a simple mechanism for including a static header and footer on each page.</li>
</ul>
<p>To expand on this last point, if you create a directory in your web area called
"<kbd>include</kbd>" and place files in it called "<kbd>header</kbd>" and
"<kbd>footer</kbd>", these files will be statically added to the top and bottom
of every page respectively. This is a convenient way to add the HTML
<kbd>&lt;head&gt;</kbd> section and a navigation menu to your site without
having to write it on every page.</p>
<p class="note">
  One unexpected feature of the HepForge web space is that Web sites written using "frames" will
  not display properly. This is due to the way that the HepForge Web server processes the pages
  you write, merging generic HepForge structures and definitions with the user-provided part
  of the page. In future we hope to make the degrading more "graceful".
  For now we'll justify the lack of functionality by pointing out that frames have plenty of
  useability issues of their own and that a lot of Web development guides (specifically, the ones
  that know what they're talking about) recommend not using them.
</p>
<h3>Version control systems</h3>
<p>We encourage you to use a code management system. This will keep a record of all
the changes you make to your code and allows roll-backs to previous known-good
versions should something go wrong. Code management systems also allow several
different developers to work on the same code at the same time, while minimising
conflicts and change-merging difficulties. Lastly, you can "tag" particular
states of your code so that they are easily retrieved, for example when you make
a new release.</p>
<p>HepForge now provides official support for the <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>, <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a> and <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>
 version control systems. For new projects we recommend using Mercurial,
a good introduction is at http://hginit.com/.</p>
<p>We're happy to help with version control issues,
particularly if it'll help introduce new developers to this essential feature of
robust development!  However, before contacting us with queries, you should read
the available documentation.</p>
<h4>Your HepForge Subversion repository</h4>
<p>If you don't pick a version control system, your project automatically has an SVN repository on HepForge, stored on the
filesystem at <kbd>/hepforge/svn/<span class="generic">projname</span></kbd>.
If you want to restrict access to areas of this repository to particular
authenticated users, you can use the <kbd>svnserve.conf</kbd> file, which is
located in the <kbd>conf</kbd> directory of the repository (and is also
symlinked from your project's <kbd>project-config</kbd> directory).</p>
<p>Users wanting to access your repository can use either the svn+ssh protocol or
http. Commits are currently only possible over svn+ssh, which also requires a
user account on HepForge so this is the advised protocol for project
developers. HTTP is currently mainly useful for anonymous checkouts. The SVN
path for svn+ssh developer access is
<kbd>svn+ssh://svn.hepforge.org/hepforge/svn/<span class="generic">projname</span>/...</kbd>. SVN has a tendency to want to make
two or three SSH connections, so you may get quite a few password prompts:
setting up public key based SSH access is advised if you'll be doing a lot of
svn+ssh access.</p>
<p>For HTTP access you can view your repository via the Web by pointing your web
browser at <kbd>http://<span class="generic">projname</span>.hepforge.org/svn/...</kbd>. The same path can be used as an
argument to the <kbd>svn</kbd> command line program.</p>
<p>Finally, you can view your SVN repository by using the neat viewer built into
your project's Trac system - more about that later.</p>
<p>You can also use these URLs with SSL encryption if you wish: to do so, replace
the <kbd>http</kbd> with <kbd>https</kbd> in the URLs above.</p>
<h3>Mailing lists</h3>
<p>By default, when we create a project, we will set up one mailing list,
with names <kbd><span class="generic">projname</span>@projects.hepforge.org</kbd>. On request, we'll also set up
<kbd><span class="generic">projname</span>-announce@projects.hepforge.org</kbd>.  The
<kbd><span class="generic">projname</span>@projects.hepforge.org</kbd> list is the contact
list for project administrators and the <kbd><span class="generic">projname</span>-announce@projects.hepforge.org</kbd> list is for you to
keep users of your project informed of new versions or other useful
developments. If required, we can also set up additional lists with suffixes
other than "announce", but all lists for a given project will be prefixed with
the project name.</p>
<p>You can manage your own mailing lists using the Mailman system: this will
allow you to specify, for example, whether the list is open or moderated (the
admin contact list should be open, the announce list should be moderated, and if
for example you set up a discussion list, that should be open too).</p>
<p>Please note that you shouldn't send large attachments to the HepForge lists: the
lists have message size quotas, which are easily overflowed by binary attachments.</p>
<h3>Download manager</h3>
<p>When you release a new version of your code, the "HepForge way" is to place it
in the <kbd>/downloads</kbd> directory of your project home area,
with a filename of the form <kbd><span class="generic">name</span>-<span class="generic">x</span>.<span class="generic">y</span>.<span class="generic">z</span>.tar.gz</kbd> (other archive formats,
e.g. <kbd>.zip</kbd>, can also be used). The <span class="generic">name</span>
part can include any characters other than a minus (dash) character followed by
a digit: this is used to indicate the division between name and version
code. The version code can contain as many "levels" as you wish, though the
threefold <span class="generic">x, y, z</span> form above is the most
popular. The <span class="generic">x, y, z</span> variables can each have more
than one digit and will be sorted appropriately: for example,
"<kbd>proj-2.0.1.tar.gz</kbd>" is a less recent version of the "my-proj" code
than "<kbd>my-proj-10.0.1.tar.gz</kbd>".</p>
<p>The archived code will be made available through a Web listing at <kbd>
<a href="http://www.hepforge.org/downloads">http://www.hepforge.org/downloads</a></kbd> and archive files
can be linked to directly at <kbd>http://www.hepforge.org/archive/<span class="generic">projname</span>/<span class="generic">archive-filename</span></kbd>.</p>
<h3>Bug tracker</h3>
<p>All HepForge projects have access to a copy of the <a href="http://www.edgewall.com/trac/">Trac</a> bug tracking
system, located at <kbd>https://<span class="generic">projname</span>.hepforge.org/trac/</kbd>.  Trac includes tracking of
"tickets" (i.e. bug reports), as well as management of project milestones,
integration with version control for your project's source code and a
wiki, as described briefly in the next section.</p>
<p>Trac integrates very nicely with the rest of the HepForge system: users are
authenticated using their Hepforge logins, additional users can be added in the
standard Apache <kbd>htpasswd</kbd> and <kbd>htgroup</kbd> files. These authentication
files are stored in your project configuration area (<kbd>/hepforge/home/<span class="generic">projname</span>/project-config</kbd>) as described in the
<a href="https://www.hepforge.org/docs/faq#httpauth">corresponding FAQ entry</a>. Project configuration is performed
using an interactive system from the command shell, called
<kbd>trac-admin</kbd>, which is started as follows:</p>
<p><kbd class="display">trac-admin /hepforge/projconf/<span class="generic">projname</span>/trac</kbd></p>
<p>You may also find it useful to configure Trac's appearance and behaviour using
the <kbd>trac.ini</kbd> file located in <kbd>.../project-config/trac/conf/</kbd>. Using
<kbd>trac-admin</kbd> and configuring Trac's ini file are described in great
(and clear) detail in <a href="http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/">the Trac project wiki</a>.</p>
<p class="note">
Note that SSL encryption is available for all HepForge pages and we force
all Trac sessions to use it. Without SSL encryption, your project area login
password will be sent across the internet in plain text and could easily be
"sniffed". To use SSL encryption, make sure that the start of the web address in
your browser reads <kbd>https</kbd> rather than just <kbd>http</kbd>. Your
browser will probably also show a lock icon somewhere to indicate the security
level.
</p>
<h3>Wiki</h3>
<p>The Trac bug tracking system also includes a wiki, which integrates fully with
the bug tracking features. A wiki is a collaborative documentation system, which
uses a simplified markup language to produce web pages. Setting up users with
different permissions to add, edit, delete (and so on) wiki pages, is also
performed using the <kbd>trac-admin</kbd> script or Trac's admin webpage, so you should check out the
<a href="http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/">Trac project wiki</a> for wiki questions, too. If you can't find what
you're looking for, send an email to us at <a href="mailto:admin@hepforge.org" title="HepForge contact email">admin@hepforge.org</a> and
we'll see if we can help.</p>
<h3>Software build/configuration systems</h3>
<h4>Native-compiled languages</h4>
<p>We encourage all projects writing FORTRAN, C or C++ code to use the GNU
autotools build system. This system automates the building and maintaining of
<kbd>Makefile</kbd>s, transparently handles system-specific incompatibilities,
allows to test for the existence of other (required or optional) packages on the
user's system and provides a very standard ("<kbd>./configure; make; make
install</kbd>") routine for users to build and install your code. Your HepForge
shell account has access to the latest versions of the autotools programs and we
are happy to help you get started with using them.</p>
<h4>Java</h4>
<p>If you are writing any Java software, then the Maven 2 build system is recommended:
this performs much the same role as the autotools and handles unit tests and classpaths
brilliantly. If you're into doing everything yourself, then Ant is also a good system,
but is more analogous to a portable version of Make than automake.</p>
