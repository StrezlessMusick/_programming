CD CONTENTS:
To view the contents of this CD, open volume or root level 'index.htm' 
with a web browser.

This CD contains:
1. 8088 ASSEMBLER AND TRACER TOOLKIT

The 8088_tracer directory contains the 8088 Assembler and Tracer 
Toolkit, consisting of an assembler, simulator, and tracer for the Intel 
8088 family of processors. This toolkit is designed to teach the 
rudiments of assembly language programming. It has been carefully 
designed for educational use, and has been tested in classes for over 10 
years. No previous experience with assembly language programming 
is needed to use it. 

Using this toolkit, you can assemble x86 assembly language programs 
you have written, and then run the resulting binary programs on the 
included tracer (interpreter). Using the tracer, you can step through 
your programs one line at a time, run them to specific breakpoints, and 
perform other tasks to debug your programs and learn how the 8088 
processor works. 

The directory contains subdirectories that include versions of the 
software designed to work on the following platforms:

* Microsoft Windows
* Intel/Linux (e.g., little endian) platforms
* SPARC/Solaris (e.g., big endian) platforms

To install this software package, create a directory called tracer on 
your hard disk. Next, copy the contents of the appropriate CD-ROM 
subdirectory into the tracer directory. Then, follow the installation 
instructions in the README.TXT file contained in that folder. 

Note that the README.txt file in the main 8088_tracer directory 
contains instructions for installing all three versions of the software. 

The software in the 8088_tracer directory was written in C by several 
programmers under the supervision of Evert Wattel of the Vrije 
Universiteit, who also wrote the user manual.

Important Note: Prior to installing the 8088 ASSEMBLER AND TRACER TOOLKIT, 
please review the Prentice Hall End-User License Agreement (EULA) in the 
back of the book, Structured Computer Organization, 5th Edition.

2. Mic-1 MMV SIMULATION ENVIRONMENT

Mic-1 MMV is a program that provides a simulation environment for 
the Mic-1 machine discussed in Chapter 4. It is designed to show how 
one could implement a subset of JVM using microcode, as described 
in great detail in Chapter 4. 

Mic-1 MMV allows users to assemble IJVM programs and run them at 
various speeds, ranging from 1/4 of the clock cycle to nonstop. A 
graphical user interface shows what is happening in great detail, both 
at the IJVM level and at the microcode level. Users can also modify 
the microcode and test it. 

This software is written in Java and should run on any Java platform. It 
is highly graphical in nature, has a sophisticated user interface, and 
comes with extensive built-in documentation. To install it, copy the entire
Mic1MMV directory to your hard disk and then see the README.txt 
file contained in it for further instructions. 

This software was written by Richard M. Salter of Oberlin College, 
building on previous work by Ray Ontko. Any updates to Mic-1 MMV
will be available at: 

http://www.prenhall.com/tanenbaum

To access Mic-1 MMV updates, browse to that page, and click on the 
Companion Web Site link for this book.

GNU General Public License, Version 2, June 1991. You can find the license
