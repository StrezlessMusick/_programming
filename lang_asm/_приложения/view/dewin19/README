	fixed SIB parsing of some 0F - opcodes

 4/03/99
        added custom .data and .rsrc naming options

        added [module name].udf definition file processing
        if not found (for example, COMMDLG.UDF), default
        userdef.txt is loaded instead

 8/01/98
	removed temporal file creation for post-processing, resulting
	faster processing and half HDD free space requirements

	some code cleanup

	post-processor is now enabled for 32bit app's also

19/12/98
	fixed Import section processing for PE files
	if normal section ordering is destroyed

12/12/98
	added post-processor
	fixed some operand-size prefix bugs

	.dll name to exclude from names list may be now more than one
	at a time, e.g. mfc42.dll and ogl32.dll simultaneously

	auto-skip sequences of NOP used by compiler for code
	alignment

        C-style strings in codeseg autodetection

	32-bit version of User-defines, see dewin.doc

        fixed looping bug if user-def cstring has no chars except '\0'

11/07/98 added:
	lar	r16,r/m16	recognition in 16 bit mode

	userdef.txt file import
