<H1>Programming - Ch 3 Exercise Solutions</H1></CENTER>
<P align=right>Modified July 20, 2009. 
<UL>
  <LI><B>Exercise 4</B>: Write a program that prompts the user to enter two 
  integer values. Store these values in <B>int</B> variables named <B>val1</B> 
  and <B>val2</B>. Write your program to determine the smallest, largest, sum, 
  difference, product, and ratio of these values and report them to the user.

  code</A>. </P>
  <LI><B>Exercise 6</B>: 
  <LI>Write a program that prompts the user to enter 3 integer values, and then 
  outputs the values in numerical sequence separated by commas. So: if the user 
  enters the values 10 4 6, the output should be 4, 6, 10. If two values are the 
  same, they should just be ordered together. So, the input 4 5 4 should give 4, 
  4, 5.

  <LI><B>Exercise 8</B>: Write a program to test an integer value to determine 
  if it is odd or even. As always, make sure your output is clear and complete. 
  In other words, don't just output "yes" or "no". Your output should stand 
  alone, like ``The value 4 is an even number.'' Hint: see the Remainder 
  (modulo) operator in 2.4.

  <LI><B>Exercise 9</B>: Write a program that converts spelled out numbers such 
  as "zero" and "two" into digits, such as 0 and 2. When the user inputs a 
  number print out the corresponding digit. Do it for the values 0,1,2,3, and 4 
  and write out "not a number I know" if the user enters something that doesn't 
  correspond, such as ``stupid computer!''

  <LI><B>Exercise 10</B>: Write a program that takes an operation followed by 
  two operands and outputs the result. For example: 
  <UL>
    <LI><B>+ 100 3.14</B> 
    <LI><B>* 4 5</B> </LI></UL>Read the operation into a string called 
  <B>operation</B> and use an if-statement to figure out which operation the 
  user wants. For example, <B>if (operation=="+")</B>. Read the operands into 
  variables of type <B>double</B>. Implement this for operations called +, -, *, 
  /, plus, minus, mul, and div with their obvious meanings.
