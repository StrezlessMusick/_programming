<H1>Programming -- Principles and Practice Using C++</H1></CENTER>This is the 
support site for Stroustrup: "Programming: Principles and Practice using C++" 
Addison-Wesley 2009, ISBN 978-0321543721. 
<P>
<CENTER></CENTER>
<P>This book is aimed at beginners taking a programming course and people 
learning C++ as self study. For details, see these samples:

<P>This book is based on a course I designed for engineering freshmen at Texas 
A&amp;M University. It has now been taught by me and others for three years and 
to more than 1200 students. It is currently available in (physical and web) book 
stores. 
<P>I wrote an academic paper to explain a possible role for the book/course in a 
more complete education: <A 
href="http://www.research.att.com/~bs/software.pdf">Programming in an 
undergraduate CS curriculum</A> 
<P>Note this is <I>not</I> the 4th edition of <A 
href="http://www.research.att.com/~bs/3rd.html">The C++ Programming Language</A> 
and it uses the current ISO standard C++, <A 
href="http://www.research.att.com/~bs/C++.html">C++98</A>, rather than the still 
future <A href="http://www.research.att.com/~bs/C++0xFAQ.html">C++0x</A>. 
<P>This page and its supporting material is under construction. Comments and 
suggestions are welcome. In particular, I'd like to hear if someone adopts the 
book for a course. Maybe we could set up a mechanism for sharing experience.

<P>By the numbers: 
<UL>
  <LI>1268 pages 
  <LI>28 chapters 
  <LI>5 appendices 
  <LI>1 preface 
  <LI>1 glossary 
  <LI>1 index 
  <LI>just over a quarter of a million words 
  <LI>39 photos 
  <LI>67 screen shots 
  <LI>167 diagrams 
  <LI>120 tables 
  <LI>375 exercises 
  <LI>26 drills 
  <LI>650 review questions 
  <LI>55 bibliographical references 
  <LI>4lb==1.83kg (that's much heavier than my laptop!) </LI></UL>What do such 
numbers mean? Not much; e.g., is the word count a sign of "lots of useful 
information" or proof of verbosity? I prefer the former explanation.

<P>I am assuming that you (the reader) have a working <A 
href="http://www.research.att.com/~bs/compilers.html">modern C++ compiler</A>. 
If you are a student on a programming course, your school will have installed 
one and there will be teachers or teaching assistent to help you in case of 
trouble. If you are on your own and not an experienced programmer, I strongly 
recommend you seek help from someone who has installed software before. One 
problem is that there are lots of C++ compilers and operating system 
distributions, so I can't simply provide you with a simple description of how to 
install: It will depend on "which compiler?" and which "operating system?" Here 
is a <A 
href="http://free.prohosting.com/holeman/cgi-bin/get_page.cgi?../cxx/sw_stack">writeup</A> 
sent to me by a reader using the Ubuntu distribution of Linux and GCC. And here 
is a <A href="http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/Mac-Makefile">Makefile for

<P>Why birds? Just because I like that photo; I was looking for a calm image. 
Sometimes a bird is just a bird. They are swans, by the way.
