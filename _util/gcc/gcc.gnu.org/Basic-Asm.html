<h4 class="subsection">6.43.1 Basic Asm &mdash; Assembler Instructions with No Operands</h4>

<p><a name="index-basic-_0040code_007basm_007d-3255"></a>
The <code>asm</code> keyword allows you to embed assembler instructions within
C code.

<pre class="example">     asm [ volatile ] ( AssemblerInstructions )
</pre>
 <p>To create headers compatible with ISO C, write <code>__asm__</code> instead of
<code>asm</code> (see <a href="Alternate-Keywords.html#Alternate-Keywords">Alternate Keywords</a>).

 <p>By definition, a Basic <code>asm</code> statement is one with no operands. 
<code>asm</code> statements that contain one or more colons (used to delineate
operands) are considered to be Extended (for example, <code>asm("int $3")</code>
is Basic, and <code>asm("int $3" : )</code> is Extended). See <a href="Extended-Asm.html#Extended-Asm">Extended Asm</a>.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Qualifiers</h5>

<p><em>volatile</em>
<br>
This optional qualifier has no effect. All Basic <code>asm</code> blocks are
implicitly volatile.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Parameters</h5>

<p><em>AssemblerInstructions</em>
<br>
This is a literal string that specifies the assembler code. The string can
contain any instructions recognized by the assembler, including directives. 
GCC does not parse the assembler instructions themselves and
does not know what they mean or even whether they are valid assembler input. 
The compiler copies it verbatim to the assembly language output file, without
processing dialects or any of the "%" operators that are available with
Extended <code>asm</code>. This results in minor differences between Basic
<code>asm</code> strings and Extended <code>asm</code> templates. For example, to refer to
registers you might use %%eax in Extended <code>asm</code> and %eax in Basic
<code>asm</code>.

 <p>You may place multiple assembler instructions together in a single <code>asm</code>
string, separated by the characters normally used in assembly code for the
system. A combination that works in most places is a newline to break the
line, plus a tab character (written as "\n\t"). 
Some assemblers allow semicolons as a line separator. However,
note that some assembler dialects use semicolons to start a comment.

 <p>Do not expect a sequence of <code>asm</code> statements to remain perfectly
consecutive after compilation. If certain instructions need to remain
consecutive in the output, put them in a single multi-instruction asm
statement. Note that GCC's optimizers can move <code>asm</code> statements
relative to other code, including across jumps.

 <p><code>asm</code> statements may not perform jumps into other <code>asm</code> statements. 
GCC does not know about these jumps, and therefore cannot take
account of them when deciding how to optimize. Jumps from <code>asm</code> to C
labels are only supported in Extended <code>asm</code>.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Remarks</h5>

<p>Using Extended <code>asm</code> will typically produce smaller, safer, and more
efficient code, and in most cases it is a better solution. When writing
inline assembly language outside of C functions, however, you must use Basic
<code>asm</code>. Extended <code>asm</code> statements have to be inside a C function. 
Functions declared with the <code>naked</code> attribute also require Basic
<code>asm</code> (see <a href="Function-Attributes.html#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>).

 <p>Under certain circumstances, GCC may duplicate (or remove duplicates of) your
assembly code when optimizing. This can lead to unexpected duplicate
symbol errors during compilation if your assembly code defines symbols or
labels.

 <p>Safely accessing C data and calling functions from Basic <code>asm</code> is more
complex than it may appear. To access C data, it is better to use Extended
<code>asm</code>.

 <p>Since GCC does not parse the AssemblerInstructions, it has no
visibility of any symbols it references. This may result in GCC discarding
those symbols as unreferenced.

 <p>Unlike Extended <code>asm</code>, all Basic <code>asm</code> blocks are implicitly
volatile. See <a href="Volatile.html#Volatile">Volatile</a>.  Similarly, Basic <code>asm</code> blocks are not treated
as though they used a "memory" clobber (see <a href="Clobbers.html#Clobbers">Clobbers</a>).

 <p>All Basic <code>asm</code> blocks use the assembler dialect specified by the
<samp><span class="option">-masm</span></samp> command-line option. Basic <code>asm</code> provides no
mechanism to provide different assembler strings for different dialects.

 <p>Here is an example of Basic <code>asm</code> for i386:

<pre class="example">     /* Note that this code will not compile with -masm=intel */
     #define DebugBreak() asm("int $3")
</pre>
 </body></html>
