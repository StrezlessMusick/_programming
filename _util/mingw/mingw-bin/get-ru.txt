Управление установкой MinGW и MSYS (command line user interface).

Usage:
  mingw-get [OPTIONS] ACTION [package-spec[version-bounds] ...]

  mingw-get update
  mingw-get [OPTIONS] {install | upgrade | remove} package-spec ...
  mingw-get [OPTIONS] {show | list} [package-spec ...]

Options:
  --help, -h        Show this help text

  --version, -V     Show version and licence information

  --verbose, -v     Увеличивает многослованость вывода сообщений
                    диагностики или процесса;
                    уровень многослословности =3
  --verbose=N       Устанавливает уровень многословности на N; (0 <= N <= 3)

  --trace=N         Enable tracing feature N; (debugging aid)

  --reinstall       When performing an install or upgrade
                    operation, reinstall any named package
                    for which the most recent release is
                    already installed

  --recursive       Extend the scope of "install --reinstall"
                    or of "upgrade", such that the operation
                    is applied recursively to all prerequisites
                    of all packages named on the command line

  --download-only   Download the package archive files which
                    would be required to complete the specified
                    install, upgrade, or source operation, but
                    do not unpack them, or otherwise proceed
                    to complete the operation

  --print-uris      Display the repository URIs from which
                    package archive files would be retrieved
                    prior to performing the specified install,
                    upgrade, or source operation, but do not
                    download any package file, or otherwise
                    proceed with the operation

  --all-related     When performing source or licence operations,
                    causes mingw-get to retrieve, and optionally to
                    unpack the source or licence archives for all
                    runtime prerequisites of, and in addition to,
                    the nominated package

  --desktop[=all-users]
                    Enable the creation of desktop shortcuts, for
                    packages which provide the capability via pre-
                    or post-install scripts; the optional 'all-users'
                    qualifier requests that all such shortcuts are
                    to be made available to all users; without it
                    shortcuts will be created for current user only

                    Note that specification of this option does not
                    guarantee that shortcuts will be created; the
                    onus lies with individual package maintainers
                    to provide scripting to support this capability

  --start-menu[=all-users]
                    Enable the creation of start menu shortcuts, for
                    packages which provide the capability via pre-
                    or post-install scripts; the optional 'all-users'
                    qualifier requests that all such shortcuts are
                    to be made available to all users; without it
                    shortcuts will be created for current user only

                    Note that specification of this option does not
                    guarantee that shortcuts will be created; the
                    onus lies with individual package maintainers
                    to provide scripting to support this capability

Actions:
  update            Update local copy of repository catalogues
  list, show        List and show details of available packages
  source            Download and optionally unpack package sources
  licence           Download and optionally unpack licence packages,
                    handling them as if they are source packages
  install           Install new packages
  upgrade           Upgrade previously installed packages
  remove            Remove previously installed packages

Package Specifications:
  [subsystem-]name[-component]:
  msys-bash-doc     The 'doc' component of the bash package for MSYS
  mingw32-gdb       All components of the gdb package for MinGW

Version Bounds (for install or upgrade actions):
  {>|>=|=|<=|<}major[.minor[.rev]][-subsystem-major[.minor[.rev]]]:
  "gcc=4.5.*"       Latest available release of GCC version 4.5.x
  "gcc<4.6"         Alternative representation for GCC version 4.5.x

Use 'mingw-get list' to identify possible package names, and the
components associated with each.

Quote package names with attached version bounds specifications, to
avoid possible misinterpretation of shell operators.  Do NOT insert
white space at any point within any "package-spec[version-bounds]"
specification string.
