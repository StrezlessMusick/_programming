<h3 class="section">16.1 Basic Installation</h3>

<p>Briefly, the shell commands &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">./configure; make; make install</span></samp>&rsquo;
should configure, build, and install this package.  The following
more-detailed instructions are generic; see the <samp><span class="file">README</span></samp> file for
instructions specific to this package. 
More recommendations for GNU packages can be found in
<a href="../standards/Makefile-Conventions.html#Makefile-Conventions">Makefile Conventions</a>.

   <p>The <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> shell script attempts to guess correct values
for various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp> in each directory of the
package.  It may also create one or more <samp><span class="file">.h</span></samp> files containing
system-dependent definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script
<samp><span class="file">config.status</span></samp> that you can run in the future to recreate the
current configuration, and a file <samp><span class="file">config.log</span></samp> containing compiler
output (useful mainly for debugging <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>).

   <p>It can also use an optional file (typically called <samp><span class="file">config.cache</span></samp>
and enabled with <samp><span class="option">--cache-file=config.cache</span></samp> or simply
<samp><span class="option">-C</span></samp>) that saves the results of its tests to speed up
reconfiguring.  Caching is disabled by default to prevent problems with
accidental use of stale cache files.

   <p>If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try to
figure out how <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> could check whether to do them, and
mail diffs or instructions to the address given in the <samp><span class="file">README</span></samp> so
they can be considered for the next release.  If you are using the
cache, and at some point <samp><span class="file">config.cache</span></samp> contains results you don't
want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

   <p>The file <samp><span class="file">configure.ac</span></samp> (or <samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp>) is used to create
<samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> by a program called <samp><span class="command">autoconf</span></samp>.  You need
<samp><span class="file">configure.ac</span></samp> if you want to change it or regenerate
<samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> using a newer version of <samp><span class="command">autoconf</span></samp>.

   <p>The simplest way to compile this package is:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li><samp><span class="command">cd</span></samp> to the directory containing the package's source code and type
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">./configure</span></samp>&rsquo; to configure the package for your system.

     <p>Running <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> might take a while.  While running, it prints some
messages telling which features it is checking for.

     <li>Type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo; to compile the package.

     <li>Optionally, type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make check</span></samp>&rsquo; to run any self-tests that come with
the package, generally using the just-built uninstalled binaries.

     <li>Type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make install</span></samp>&rsquo; to install the programs and any data files and
documentation.  When installing into a prefix owned by root, it is
recommended that the package be configured and built as a regular user,
and only the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make install</span></samp>&rsquo; phase executed with root privileges.

     <li>Optionally, type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make installcheck</span></samp>&rsquo; to repeat any self-tests, but
this time using the binaries in their final installed location.  This
target does not install anything.  Running this target as a regular
user, particularly if the prior &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make install</span></samp>&rsquo; required root
privileges, verifies that the installation completed correctly.

     <li>You can remove the program binaries and object files from the source
code directory by typing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make clean</span></samp>&rsquo;.  To also remove the files
that <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> created (so you can compile the package for a
different kind of computer), type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make distclean</span></samp>&rsquo;.  There is also
a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make maintainer-clean</span></samp>&rsquo; target, but that is intended mainly for
the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get all sorts
of other programs in order to regenerate files that came with the
distribution.

     <li>Often, you can also type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make uninstall</span></samp>&rsquo; to remove the installed
files again.  In practice, not all packages have tested that
uninstallation works correctly, even though it is required by the
GNU Coding Standards.

     <li>Some packages, particularly those that use Automake, provide &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make
distcheck</span></samp>&rsquo;, which can by used by developers to test that all other
targets like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make install</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make uninstall</span></samp>&rsquo; work
correctly.  This target is generally not run by end users.
