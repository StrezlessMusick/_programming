<h3 class="section">10.2 Macro Names</h3>

<p>All of the public Autoconf macros have all-uppercase names in the
namespace &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^AC_</span></samp>&rsquo; to prevent them from accidentally conflicting with
other text; Autoconf also reserves the namespace &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^_AC_</span></samp>&rsquo; for
internal macros.  All shell variables that they use for internal
purposes have mostly-lowercase names starting with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ac_</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Autoconf
also uses here-document delimiters in the namespace &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^_AC[A-Z]</span></samp>&rsquo;.  During
<samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>, files produced by Autoconf make heavy use of the
file system namespace &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^conf</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Since Autoconf is built on top of M4sugar (see <a href="Programming-in-M4sugar.html#Programming-in-M4sugar">Programming in M4sugar</a>) and M4sh (see <a href="Programming-in-M4sh.html#Programming-in-M4sh">Programming in M4sh</a>), you must also be aware
of those namespaces (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^_?\(m4\|AS\)_</span></samp>&rsquo;).  And since
<samp><span class="file">configure.ac</span></samp> is also designed to be scanned by Autoheader,
Autoscan, Autoupdate, and Automake, you should be aware of the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^_?A[HNUM]_</span></samp>&rsquo; namespaces.  In general, you <em>should not use</em>
the namespace of a package that does not own the macro or shell code you
are writing.

   <p>To ensure that your macros don't conflict with present or future
Autoconf macros, you should prefix your own macro names and any shell
variables they use with some other sequence.  Possibilities include your
initials, or an abbreviation for the name of your organization or
software package.  Historically, people have not always followed the
rule of using a namespace appropriate for their package, and this has
made it difficult for determining the origin of a macro (and where to
report bugs about that macro), as well as difficult for the true
namespace owner to add new macros without interference from pre-existing
uses of third-party macros.  Perhaps the best example of this confusion
is the <code>AM_GNU_GETTEXT</code> macro, which belongs, not to Automake, but
to Gettext.

   <p>Most of the Autoconf macros' names follow a structured naming convention
that indicates the kind of feature check by the name.  The macro names
consist of several words, separated by underscores, going from most
general to most specific.  The names of their cache variables use the
same convention (see <a href="Cache-Variable-Names.html#Cache-Variable-Names">Cache Variable Names</a>, for more information on
them).

   <p>The first word of the name after the namespace initials (such as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">AC_</span></samp>&rsquo;) usually tells the category
of the feature being tested.  Here are the categories used in Autoconf for
specific test macros, the kind of macro that you are more likely to
write.  They are also used for cache variables, in all-lowercase.  Use
them where applicable; where they're not, invent your own categories.

     <dl>
<dt><code>C</code><dd>C language builtin features. 
<br><dt><code>DECL</code><dd>Declarations of C variables in header files. 
<br><dt><code>FUNC</code><dd>Functions in libraries. 
<br><dt><code>GROUP</code><dd>Posix group owners of files. 
<br><dt><code>HEADER</code><dd>Header files. 
<br><dt><code>LIB</code><dd>C libraries. 
<br><dt><code>PROG</code><dd>The base names of programs. 
<br><dt><code>MEMBER</code><dd>Members of aggregates. 
<br><dt><code>SYS</code><dd>Operating system features. 
<br><dt><code>TYPE</code><dd>C builtin or declared types. 
<br><dt><code>VAR</code><dd>C variables in libraries. 
</dl>

   <p>After the category comes the name of the particular feature being
tested.  Any further words in the macro name indicate particular aspects
of the feature.  For example, <code>AC_PROG_CC_STDC</code> checks whether the
C compiler supports ISO Standard C.

   <p>An internal macro should have a name that starts with an underscore;
Autoconf internals should therefore start with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_AC_</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Additionally, a macro that is an internal subroutine of another macro
should have a name that starts with an underscore and the name of that
other macro, followed by one or more words saying what the internal
macro does.  For example, <code>AC_PATH_X</code> has internal macros
<code>_AC_PATH_X_XMKMF</code> and <code>_AC_PATH_X_DIRECT</code>.
