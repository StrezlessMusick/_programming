<h3 class="section">12.20 Timestamp Resolution and Make</h3>

<p><a name="index-timestamp-resolution-1883"></a>Traditionally, file timestamps had 1-second resolution, and
<samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> used those timestamps to determine whether one file was
newer than the other.  However, many modern file systems have
timestamps with 1-nanosecond resolution.  Some <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp>
implementations look at the entire timestamp; others ignore the
fractional part, which can lead to incorrect results.  Normally this
is not a problem, but in some extreme cases you may need to use tricks
like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sleep 1</span></samp>&rsquo; to work around timestamp truncation bugs.

   <p>Commands like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cp -p</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">touch -r</span></samp>&rsquo; typically do not copy
file timestamps to their full resolutions (see <a href="touch.html#touch">Limitations of Usual Tools</a>).  Hence you should be wary of rules like this:

<pre class="example">     dest: src
             cp -p src dest
</pre>
   <p>as <samp><span class="file">dest</span></samp> often appears to be older than <samp><span class="file">src</span></samp> after the
timestamp is truncated, and this can cause <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> to do
needless rework the next time it is invoked.  To work around this
problem, you can use a timestamp file, e.g.:

<pre class="example">     dest-stamp: src
             cp -p src dest
             date &gt;dest-stamp
</pre>
   <p>Apart from timestamp resolution, there are also differences in handling
equal timestamps.  HP-UX <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> updates targets if it has the
same time stamp as one of its prerequisites, in violation of Posix rules.

   <p>This can cause spurious rebuilds for repeated runs of <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp>. 
This in turn can cause <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> to fail if it tries to rebuild
generated files in a possibly read-only source tree with tools not
present on the end-user machine.  Use GNU <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> instead.
