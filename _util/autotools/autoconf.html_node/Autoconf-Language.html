<h4 class="subsection">3.1.2 The Autoconf Language</h4>

<p><a name="index-quotation-10"></a>
The Autoconf language differs from many other computer
languages because it treats actual code the same as plain text.  Whereas
in C, for instance, data and instructions have different syntactic
status, in Autoconf their status is rigorously the same.  Therefore, we
need a means to distinguish literal strings from text to be expanded:
quotation.

   <p>When calling macros that take arguments, there must not be any white
space between the macro name and the open parenthesis.

<pre class="example">     AC_INIT ([oops], [1.0]) # incorrect
     AC_INIT([hello], [1.0]) # good
</pre>
   <p>Arguments should
be enclosed within the quote characters &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo;, and be
separated by commas.  Any leading blanks or newlines in arguments are ignored,
unless they are quoted.  You should always quote an argument that
might contain a macro name, comma, parenthesis, or a leading blank or
newline.  This rule applies recursively for every macro
call, including macros called from other macros.  For more details on
quoting rules, see <a href="Programming-in-M4.html#Programming-in-M4">Programming in M4</a>.

   <p>For instance:

<pre class="example">     AC_CHECK_HEADER([stdio.h],
                     [AC_DEFINE([HAVE_STDIO_H], [1],
                        [Define to 1 if you have &lt;stdio.h&gt;.])],
                     [AC_MSG_ERROR([sorry, can't do anything for you])])
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">is quoted properly.  You may safely simplify its quotation to:

<pre class="example">     AC_CHECK_HEADER([stdio.h],
                     [AC_DEFINE([HAVE_STDIO_H], 1,
                        [Define to 1 if you have &lt;stdio.h&gt;.])],
                     [AC_MSG_ERROR([sorry, can't do anything for you])])
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">because &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>&rsquo; cannot contain a macro call.  Here, the argument of
<code>AC_MSG_ERROR</code> must be quoted; otherwise, its comma would be
interpreted as an argument separator.  Also, the second and third arguments
of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">AC_CHECK_HEADER</span></samp>&rsquo; must be quoted, since they contain
macro calls.  The three arguments &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">HAVE_STDIO_H</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">stdio.h</span></samp>&rsquo;,
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Define to 1 if you have &lt;stdio.h&gt;.</span></samp>&rsquo; do not need quoting, but
if you unwisely defined a macro with a name like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Define</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">stdio</span></samp>&rsquo; then they would need quoting.  Cautious Autoconf users
would keep the quotes, but many Autoconf users find such precautions
annoying, and would rewrite the example as follows:

<pre class="example">     AC_CHECK_HEADER(stdio.h,
                     [AC_DEFINE(HAVE_STDIO_H, 1,
                        [Define to 1 if you have &lt;stdio.h&gt;.])],
                     [AC_MSG_ERROR([sorry, can't do anything for you])])
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This is safe, so long as you adopt good naming conventions and do not
define macros with names like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">HAVE_STDIO_H</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">stdio</span></samp>&rsquo;, or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">h</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Though it is also safe here to omit the quotes around
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Define to 1 if you have &lt;stdio.h&gt;.</span></samp>&rsquo; this is not recommended, as
message strings are more likely to inadvertently contain commas.

   <p>The following example is wrong and dangerous, as it is underquoted:

<pre class="example">     AC_CHECK_HEADER(stdio.h,
                     AC_DEFINE(HAVE_STDIO_H, 1,
                        Define to 1 if you have &lt;stdio.h&gt;.),
                     AC_MSG_ERROR([sorry, can't do anything for you]))
</pre>
   <p>In other cases, you may have to use text that also resembles a macro
call.  You must quote that text even when it is not passed as a macro
argument.  For example, these two approaches in <samp><span class="file">configure.ac</span></samp>
(quoting just the potential problems, or quoting the entire line) will
protect your script in case autoconf ever adds a macro <code>AC_DC</code>:

<pre class="example">     echo "Hard rock was here!  --[AC_DC]"
     [echo "Hard rock was here!  --AC_DC"]
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which results in this text in <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp>:

<pre class="example">     echo "Hard rock was here!  --AC_DC"
     echo "Hard rock was here!  --AC_DC"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">When you use the same text in a macro argument, you must therefore have
an extra quotation level (since one is stripped away by the macro
substitution).  In general, then, it is a good idea to <em>use double
quoting for all literal string arguments</em>, either around just the
problematic portions, or over the entire argument:

<pre class="example">     AC_MSG_WARN([[AC_DC] stinks  --Iron Maiden])
     AC_MSG_WARN([[AC_DC stinks  --Iron Maiden]])
</pre>
   <p>However, the above example triggers a warning about a possibly
unexpanded macro when running <samp><span class="command">autoconf</span></samp>, because it collides
with the namespace of macros reserved for the Autoconf language.  To be
really safe, you can use additional escaping (either a quadrigraph, or
creative shell constructs) to silence that particular warning:

<pre class="example">     echo "Hard rock was here!  --AC""_DC"
     AC_MSG_WARN([[AC@&amp;t@_DC stinks  --Iron Maiden]])
</pre>
   <p>You are now able to understand one of the constructs of Autoconf that
has been continually misunderstood<small class="enddots">...</small>  The rule of thumb is that
<em>whenever you expect macro expansion, expect quote expansion</em>;
i.e., expect one level of quotes to be lost.  For instance:

<pre class="example">     AC_COMPILE_IFELSE(AC_LANG_SOURCE([char b[10];]), [],
      [AC_MSG_ERROR([you lose])])
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">is incorrect: here, the first argument of <code>AC_LANG_SOURCE</code> is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">char b[10];</span></samp>&rsquo; and is expanded once, which results in
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">char b10;</span></samp>&rsquo;; and the <code>AC_LANG_SOURCE</code> is also expanded prior
to being passed to <code>AC_COMPILE_IFELSE</code>.  (There was an idiom common
in Autoconf's past to
address this issue via the M4 <code>changequote</code> primitive, but do not
use it!)  Let's take a closer look: the author meant the first argument
to be understood as a literal, and therefore it must be quoted twice;
likewise, the intermediate <code>AC_LANG_SOURCE</code> macro should be quoted
once so that it is only expanded after the rest of the body of
<code>AC_COMPILE_IFELSE</code> is in place:

<pre class="example">     AC_COMPILE_IFELSE([AC_LANG_SOURCE([[char b[10];]])], [],
       [AC_MSG_ERROR([you lose])])
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Voil&agrave;, you actually produce &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">char b[10];</span></samp>&rsquo; this time!

   <p>On the other hand, descriptions (e.g., the last parameter of
<code>AC_DEFINE</code> or <code>AS_HELP_STRING</code>) are not literals&mdash;they
are subject to line breaking, for example&mdash;and should not be double quoted. 
Even if these descriptions are short and are not actually broken, double
quoting them yields weird results.

   <p>Some macros take optional arguments, which this documentation represents
as <span class="roman">[</span><var>arg</var><span class="roman">]</span> (not to be confused with the quote characters).  You may
just leave them empty, or use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[]</span></samp>&rsquo; to make the emptiness of the
argument explicit, or you may simply omit the trailing commas.  The
three lines below are equivalent:

<pre class="example">     AC_CHECK_HEADERS([stdio.h], [], [], [])
     AC_CHECK_HEADERS([stdio.h],,,)
     AC_CHECK_HEADERS([stdio.h])
</pre>
   <p>It is best to put each macro call on its own line in
<samp><span class="file">configure.ac</span></samp>.  Most of the macros don't add extra newlines; they
rely on the newline after the macro call to terminate the commands. 
This approach makes the generated <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> script a little
easier to read by not inserting lots of blank lines.  It is generally
safe to set shell variables on the same line as a macro call, because
the shell allows assignments without intervening newlines.

   <p>You can include comments in <samp><span class="file">configure.ac</span></samp> files by starting them
with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo;.  For example, it is helpful to begin
<samp><span class="file">configure.ac</span></samp> files with a line like this:

<pre class="example">     # Process this file with autoconf to produce a configure script.
</pre>
   </body></html>
