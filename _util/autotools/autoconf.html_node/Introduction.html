   <p>Autoconf is a tool for producing shell scripts that automatically
configure software source code packages to adapt to many kinds of
Posix-like systems.  The configuration scripts produced by Autoconf
are independent of Autoconf when they are run, so their users do not
need to have Autoconf.

   <p>The configuration scripts produced by Autoconf require no manual user
intervention when run; they do not normally even need an argument
specifying the system type.  Instead, they individually test for the
presence of each feature that the software package they are for might need. 
(Before each check, they print a one-line message stating what they are
checking for, so the user doesn't get too bored while waiting for the
script to finish.)  As a result, they deal well with systems that are
hybrids or customized from the more common Posix variants.  There is
no need to maintain files that list the features supported by each
release of each variant of Posix.

   <p>For each software package that Autoconf is used with, it creates a
configuration script from a template file that lists the system features
that the package needs or can use.  After the shell code to recognize
and respond to a system feature has been written, Autoconf allows it to
be shared by many software packages that can use (or need) that feature. 
If it later turns out that the shell code needs adjustment for some
reason, it needs to be changed in only one place; all of the
configuration scripts can be regenerated automatically to take advantage
of the updated code.

<!-- "Those who do not understand Unix are condemned to reinvent it, poorly." -->
<!-- Henry Spencer, 1987 (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) -->
   <p>Those who do not understand Autoconf are condemned to reinvent it, poorly. 
The primary goal of Autoconf is making the <em>user's</em> life easier;
making the <em>maintainer's</em> life easier is only a secondary goal. 
Put another way, the primary goal is not to make the generation of
<samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> automatic for package maintainers (although patches
along that front are welcome, since package maintainers form the user
base of Autoconf); rather, the goal is to make <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp>
painless, portable, and predictable for the end user of each
<dfn>autoconfiscated</dfn> package.  And to this degree, Autoconf is highly
successful at its goal &mdash; most complaints to the Autoconf list are
about difficulties in writing Autoconf input, and not in the behavior of
the resulting <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp>.  Even packages that don't use Autoconf
will generally provide a <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> script, and the most common
complaint about these alternative home-grown scripts is that they fail
to meet one or more of the GNU Coding Standards (see <a href="../standards/Configuration.html#Configuration">Configuration</a>) that users
have come to expect from Autoconf-generated <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> scripts.

   <p>The Metaconfig package is similar in purpose to Autoconf, but the
scripts it produces require manual user intervention, which is quite
inconvenient when configuring large source trees.  Unlike Metaconfig
scripts, Autoconf scripts can support cross-compiling, if some care is
taken in writing them.

   <p>Autoconf does not solve all problems related to making portable
software packages&mdash;for a more complete solution, it should be used in
concert with other GNU build tools like Automake and
Libtool.  These other tools take on jobs like the creation of a
portable, recursive makefile with all of the standard targets,
linking of shared libraries, and so on.  See <a href="The-GNU-Build-System.html#The-GNU-Build-System">The GNU Build System</a>,
for more information.

   <p>Autoconf imposes some restrictions on the names of macros used with
<code>#if</code> in C programs (see <a href="Preprocessor-Symbol-Index.html#Preprocessor-Symbol-Index">Preprocessor Symbol Index</a>).

   <p>Autoconf requires GNU M4 version 1.4.6 or later in order to
generate the scripts.  It uses features that some versions of M4,
including GNU M4 1.3, do not have.  Autoconf works better
with GNU M4 version 1.4.14 or later, though this is not
required.

   <p>See <a href="Autoconf-1.html#Autoconf-1">Autoconf 1</a>, for information about upgrading from version 1. 
See <a href="History.html#History">History</a>, for the story of Autoconf's development.  See <a href="FAQ.html#FAQ">FAQ</a>,
for answers to some common questions about Autoconf.

   <p>See the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">Autoconf web page</a> for up-to-date information, details on the mailing
lists, pointers to a list of known bugs, etc.

   <p>Mail suggestions to <a href="mailto:autoconf@gnu.org">the Autoconf mailing list</a>.  Past suggestions are
<a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf/">archived</a>.

   <p>Mail bug reports to <a href="mailto:bug-autoconf@gnu.org">the Autoconf Bugs mailing list</a>.  Past bug reports are
<a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-autoconf/">archived</a>.

   <p>If possible, first check that your bug is
not already solved in current development versions, and that it has not
been reported yet.  Be sure to include all the needed information and a
short <samp><span class="file">configure.ac</span></samp> that demonstrates the problem.

   <p>Autoconf's development tree is accessible via <samp><span class="command">git</span></samp>; see the
<a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/autoconf/">Autoconf Summary</a> for details, or view
<a href="http://git.sv.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=autoconf.git">the actual repository</a>.  Anonymous CVS access is also available, see
<samp><span class="file">README</span></samp> for more details.  Patches relative to the
current <samp><span class="command">git</span></samp> version can be sent for review to the
<a href="mailto:autoconf-patches@gnu.org">Autoconf Patches mailing list</a>, with
discussion on prior patches
<a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf-patches/">archived</a>; and all commits are posted in the read-only
<a href="mailto:autoconf-commit@gnu.org">Autoconf Commit mailing list</a>, which is
also <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf-commit/">archived</a>.

   <p>Because of its mission, the Autoconf package itself
includes only a set of often-used
macros that have already demonstrated their usefulness.  Nevertheless,
if you wish to share your macros, or find existing ones, see the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive/">Autoconf Macro Archive</a>, which is kindly run by <a href="mailto:simons@cryp.to">Peter Simons</a>.
