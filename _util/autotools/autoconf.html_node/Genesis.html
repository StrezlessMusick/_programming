<h3 class="section">21.1 Genesis</h3>

<p>In June 1991 I was maintaining many of the GNU utilities for the
Free Software Foundation.  As they were ported to more platforms and
more programs were added, the number of <samp><span class="option">-D</span></samp> options that users
had to select in the makefile (around 20) became burdensome. 
Especially for me&mdash;I had to test each new release on a bunch of
different systems.  So I wrote a little shell script to guess some of
the correct settings for the fileutils package, and released it as part
of fileutils 2.0.  That <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> script worked well enough that
the next month I adapted it (by hand) to create similar <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>
scripts for several other GNU utilities packages.  Brian Berliner
also adapted one of my scripts for his CVS revision control system.

   <p>Later that summer, I learned that Richard Stallman and Richard Pixley
were developing similar scripts to use in the GNU compiler tools;
so I adapted my <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> scripts to support their evolving
interface: using the file name <samp><span class="file">Makefile.in</span></samp> as the templates;
adding &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+srcdir</span></samp>&rsquo;, the first option (of many); and creating
<samp><span class="file">config.status</span></samp> files.
