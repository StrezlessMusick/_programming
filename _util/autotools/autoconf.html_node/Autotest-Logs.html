<h4 class="subsection">19.1.2 Autotest Logs</h4>

<p>When run, the test suite creates a log file named after itself, e.g., a
test suite named <samp><span class="command">testsuite</span></samp> creates <samp><span class="file">testsuite.log</span></samp>.  It
contains a lot of information, usually more than maintainers actually
need, but therefore most of the time it contains all that is needed:

     <dl>
<dt>command line arguments<dd>A bad but unfortunately widespread habit consists of
setting environment variables before the command, such as in
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">CC=my-home-grown-cc ./testsuite</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The test suite does not
know this change, hence (i) it cannot report it to you, and (ii)
it cannot preserve the value of <code>CC</code> for subsequent runs. 
Autoconf faced exactly the same problem, and solved it by asking
users to pass the variable definitions as command line arguments. 
Autotest requires this rule, too, but has no means to enforce it; the log
then contains a trace of the variables that were changed by the user.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> excerpts<dd>The topmost lines of all the <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> files found in the source
hierarchy.  This is especially useful when bugs are reported against
development versions of the package, since the version string does not
provide sufficient information to know the exact state of the sources
the user compiled.  Of course, this relies on the use of a
<samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp>.

     <br><dt>build machine<dd>Running a test suite in a cross-compile environment is not an easy task,
since it would mean having the test suite run on a machine <var>build</var>,
while running programs on a machine <var>host</var>.  It is much simpler to
run both the test suite and the programs on <var>host</var>, but then, from
the point of view of the test suite, there remains a single environment,
<var>host</var> = <var>build</var>.  The log contains relevant information on the
state of the <var>build</var> machine, including some important environment
variables. 
<!-- FIXME: How about having an M4sh macro to say `hey, log the value -->
<!-- of `@dots{}'?  This would help both Autoconf and Autotest. -->

     <br><dt>tested programs<dd>The absolute file name and answers to <samp><span class="option">--version</span></samp> of the tested
programs (see <a href="Writing-Testsuites.html#Writing-Testsuites">Writing Testsuites</a>, <code>AT_TESTED</code>).

     <br><dt>configuration log<dd>The contents of <samp><span class="file">config.log</span></samp>, as created by <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>,
are appended.  It contains the configuration flags and a detailed report
on the configuration itself.
