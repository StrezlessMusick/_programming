<h4 class="subsection">18.6.3 Hosts and Cross-Compilation</h4>

<p><a name="index-Cross-compilation-2253"></a>
Based on the experience of compiler writers, and after long public
debates, many aspects of the cross-compilation chain have changed:

     <ul>
<li>the relationship between the build, host, and target architecture types,

     <li>the command line interface for specifying them to <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>,

     <li>the variables defined in <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>,

     <li>the enabling of cross-compilation mode. 
</ul>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

The relationship between build, host, and target have been cleaned up:
the chain of default is now simply: target defaults to host, host to
build, and build to the result of <samp><span class="command">config.guess</span></samp>.  Nevertheless,
in order to ease the transition from 2.13 to 2.50, the following
transition scheme is implemented.  <em>Do not rely on it</em>, as it will
be completely disabled in a couple of releases (we cannot keep it, as it
proves to cause more problems than it cures).

   <p>They all default to the result of running <samp><span class="command">config.guess</span></samp>, unless
you specify either <samp><span class="option">--build</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">--host</span></samp>.  In this case,
the default becomes the system type you specified.  If you specify both,
and they're different, <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> enters cross compilation
mode, so it doesn't run any tests that require execution.

   <p>Hint: if you mean to override the result of <samp><span class="command">config.guess</span></samp>,
prefer <samp><span class="option">--build</span></samp> over <samp><span class="option">--host</span></samp>.

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

For backward compatibility, <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> accepts a system
type as an option by itself.  Such an option overrides the
defaults for build, host, and target system types.  The following
configure statement configures a cross toolchain that runs on
NetBSD/alpha but generates code for GNU Hurd/sparc,
which is also the build platform.

<pre class="example">     ./configure --host=alpha-netbsd sparc-gnu
</pre>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

In Autoconf 2.13 and before, the variables <code>build</code>, <code>host</code>,
and <code>target</code> had a different semantics before and after the
invocation of <code>AC_CANONICAL_BUILD</code> etc.  Now, the argument of
<samp><span class="option">--build</span></samp> is strictly copied into <code>build_alias</code>, and is left
empty otherwise.  After the <code>AC_CANONICAL_BUILD</code>, <code>build</code> is
set to the canonicalized build type.  To ease the transition, before,
its contents is the same as that of <code>build_alias</code>.  Do <em>not</em>
rely on this broken feature.

   <p>For consistency with the backward compatibility scheme exposed above,
when <samp><span class="option">--host</span></samp> is specified but <samp><span class="option">--build</span></samp> isn't, the build
system is assumed to be the same as <samp><span class="option">--host</span></samp>, and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">build_alias</span></samp>&rsquo; is set to that value.  Eventually, this
historically incorrect behavior will go away.

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

The former scheme to enable cross-compilation proved to cause more harm
than good, in particular, it used to be triggered too easily, leaving
regular end users puzzled in front of cryptic error messages. 
<samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> could even enter cross-compilation mode only
because the compiler was not functional.  This is mainly because
<samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> used to try to detect cross-compilation, instead of
waiting for an explicit flag from the user.

   <p>Now, <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> enters cross-compilation mode if and only if
<samp><span class="option">--host</span></samp> is passed.

   <p>That's the short documentation.  To ease the transition between 2.13 and
its successors, a more complicated scheme is implemented.  <em>Do not
rely on the following</em>, as it will be removed in the near future.

   <p>If you specify <samp><span class="option">--host</span></samp>, but not <samp><span class="option">--build</span></samp>, when
<samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> performs the first compiler test it tries to run
an executable produced by the compiler.  If the execution fails, it
enters cross-compilation mode.  This is fragile.  Moreover, by the time
the compiler test is performed, it may be too late to modify the
build-system type: other tests may have already been performed. 
Therefore, whenever you specify <samp><span class="option">--host</span></samp>, be sure to specify
<samp><span class="option">--build</span></samp> too.

<pre class="example">     ./configure --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu --host=m68k-coff
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">enters cross-compilation mode.  The former interface, which
consisted in setting the compiler to a cross-compiler without informing
<samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> is obsolete.  For instance, <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>
fails if it can't run the code generated by the specified compiler if you
configure as follows:

<pre class="example">     ./configure CC=m68k-coff-gcc
</pre>
