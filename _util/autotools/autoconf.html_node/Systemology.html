<h3 class="section">6.7 Systemology</h3>

<p><a name="index-Systemology-1187"></a>
This section aims at presenting some systems and pointers to
documentation.  It may help you addressing particular problems reported
by users.

   <p><a href="http://www.opengroup.org/susv3">Posix-conforming systems</a> are
derived from the <a href="http://www.bell-labs.com/history/unix/">Unix operating system</a>.

   <p>The <a href="http://bhami.com/rosetta.html">Rosetta Stone for Unix</a>
contains a table correlating the features of various Posix-conforming
systems.  <a href="http://www.levenez.com/unix/">Unix History</a> is a
simplified diagram of how many Unix systems were derived from each
other.

   <p><a href="http://heirloom.sourceforge.net/">The Heirloom Project</a>
provides some variants of traditional implementations of Unix utilities.

     <dl>
<dt>Darwin<dd><a name="index-Darwin-1188"></a>Darwin is also known as Mac OS X.  Beware that the file system <em>can</em> be
case-preserving, but case insensitive.  This can cause nasty problems,
since for instance the installation attempt for a package having an
<samp><span class="file">INSTALL</span></samp> file can result in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make install</span></samp>&rsquo; report that
nothing was to be done!

     <p>That's all dependent on whether the file system is a UFS (case
sensitive) or HFS+ (case preserving).  By default Apple wants you to
install the OS on HFS+.  Unfortunately, there are some pieces of
software which really need to be built on UFS.  We may want to rebuild
Darwin to have both UFS and HFS+ available (and put the /local/build
tree on the UFS).

     <br><dt>QNX 4.25<dd><a name="index-QNX-4_002e25-1189"></a><!-- FIXME: Please, if you feel like writing something more precise, -->
<!-- it'd be great.  In particular, I can't understand the difference with -->
<!-- QNX Neutrino. -->
QNX is a realtime operating system running on Intel architecture
meant to be scalable from the small embedded systems to the hundred
processor super-computer.  It claims to be Posix certified.  More
information is available on the
<a href="http://www.qnx.com/">QNX home page</a>.

     <br><dt>Tru64<dd><a name="index-Tru64-1190"></a><a href="http://h30097.www3.hp.com/docs/">Documentation of several versions of Tru64</a> is available in different
formats.

     <br><dt>Unix version 7<dd><a name="index-Unix-version-7-1191"></a><a name="index-V7-1192"></a>Officially this was called the &ldquo;Seventh Edition&rdquo; of &ldquo;the UNIX
time-sharing system&rdquo; but we use the more-common name &ldquo;Unix version 7&rdquo;. 
Documentation is available in the
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/7thEdMan/">Unix Seventh Edition Manual</a>. 
Previous versions of Unix are called &ldquo;Unix version 6&rdquo;, etc., but
they were not as widely used.
