<h3 class="section">21.2 Exodus</h3>

<p>As I got feedback from users, I incorporated many improvements, using
Emacs to search and replace, cut and paste, similar changes in each of
the scripts.  As I adapted more GNU utilities packages to use
<samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> scripts, updating them all by hand became impractical. 
Rich Murphey, the maintainer of the GNU graphics utilities, sent me
mail saying that the <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> scripts were great, and asking if
I had a tool for generating them that I could send him.  No, I thought,
but I should!  So I started to work out how to generate them.  And the
journey from the slavery of hand-written <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> scripts to the
abundance and ease of Autoconf began.

   <p>Cygnus <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>, which was being developed at around that time,
is table driven; it is meant to deal mainly with a discrete number of
system types with a small number of mainly unguessable features (such as
details of the object file format).  The automatic configuration system
that Brian Fox had developed for Bash takes a similar approach.  For
general use, it seems to me a hopeless cause to try to maintain an
up-to-date database of which features each variant of each operating
system has.  It's easier and more reliable to check for most features on
the fly&mdash;especially on hybrid systems that people have hacked on
locally or that have patches from vendors installed.

   <p>I considered using an architecture similar to that of Cygnus
<samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>, where there is a single <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> script that
reads pieces of <samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp> when run.  But I didn't want to have
to distribute all of the feature tests with every package, so I settled
on having a different <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> made from each
<samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp> by a preprocessor.  That approach also offered more
control and flexibility.

   <p>I looked briefly into using the Metaconfig package, by Larry Wall,
Harlan Stenn, and Raphael Manfredi, but I decided not to for several
reasons.  The <samp><span class="command">Configure</span></samp> scripts it produces are interactive,
which I find quite inconvenient; I didn't like the ways it checked for
some features (such as library functions); I didn't know that it was
still being maintained, and the <samp><span class="command">Configure</span></samp> scripts I had
seen didn't work on many modern systems (such as System V R4 and NeXT);
it wasn't flexible in what it could do in response to a feature's
presence or absence; I found it confusing to learn; and it was too big
and complex for my needs (I didn't realize then how much Autoconf would
eventually have to grow).

   <p>I considered using Perl to generate my style of <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>
scripts, but decided that M4 was better suited to the job of simple
textual substitutions: it gets in the way less, because output is
implicit.  Plus, everyone already has it.  (Initially I didn't rely on
the GNU extensions to M4.)  Also, some of my friends at the
University of Maryland had recently been putting M4 front ends on
several programs, including <code>tvtwm</code>, and I was interested in trying
out a new language.
